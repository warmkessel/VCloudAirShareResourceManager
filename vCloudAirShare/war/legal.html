This Agreement also includes the applicable Privacy Addendum and Third Party Terms. If you do not agree to this Agreement, you must not access the Service Offering. " You" means you individually or the entity that you represent. If you are entering into this Agreement for an entity, you represent to us that you have legal authority to bind that entity. " VMware," " we," or " us" means VMware, Inc., a Delaware corporation, to the extent that you purchase the Service Offering in the United States, VMware vCloud Service G.K., a company organized and existing under the laws of Japan, to the extent that you purchase the Service Offering in Japan, and VMware International Limited, a company organized and existing under the laws of Ireland, to the extent that you purchase the Service Offering elsewhere.
                        <p>                        
                        <strong>1. The Service Offering</strong>

                        <p><b>1.2 Access to the Service Offering</b> You may access and use the Service Offering solely for your own benefit and only in accordance with this Agreement. To access the Service Offering, you must allow the Service Offering access to your Twitter Account.
